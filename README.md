# Working Hours

A system that allows recording check-in and check-out times, with access to reports and user management.
The entire project was built from scratch and organized following the MVC pattern.
The goal was to create a clean and maintainable structure without using any frameworks, handling routing, controllers, and data flow manually to better understand the full architecture of a small system.
